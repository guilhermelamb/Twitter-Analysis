## Twitter-Analysis

In this work, I will be working mostly with Data Wrangling. I will gather data from three different sources (loading a .csv file, programmatically download, and using Twitter API). You will see data from the We Rate Dogs twitter page.

This work is divided into three parts:


- Data Gathering;
- Assessing;
- Data Cleaning;
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);
- Conclusions.
